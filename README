Example RMardown problem

shinyAppDir does not recognize global.R using Rmarkdown to embed a shiny app

What I did: Start RStudio. Open mytest.Rmd (in working directory).  Click "Run Document".
What I see: "ERROR: object 'mylabel' not found" ('mylabel' is defined in global.R and referenced in server.R)

Note: runApp from console works fine (successfully references 'mylabel' from global.R)
